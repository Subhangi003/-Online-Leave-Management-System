The Leave Management System is a web-based application designed to simplify the process of submitting, tracking, and managing leave requests within an organization or institution. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, this system enables employees or students to submit leave requests through a user-friendly form, while administrators can review, approve, or reject requests efficiently via a centralized dashboard.

This project demonstrates practical full-stack web development skills, including frontend design, backend processing, and database management. It addresses a common organizational need to digitize leave workflows, reduce paperwork, and improve transparency in leave approvals.
